This report provides an update on the NetHope Emergency Response Team efforts in the aftermath of Tropical Cyclone Idai.

## Summary of Situation

On March 14, Tropical Cyclone Idai made landfall in Mozambique as a Category 3 storm. As it traveled inland, it dumped large amounts of rain over areas of Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Malawi that were already inundated from weeks of heavy rains. As the traditional rain season continues through the end of March, continued heavy rainfall in the area is causing additional issues.

The initial damage from the cyclone was mainly in the coastal city of Beira, which was right in the path of the cyclone as it made landfall. The city was cut off from the rest of the country as roads were severely damaged due to the flooding and landslides that followed in the aftermath of the cyclone. Initial reports from IFRC indicated that 90 percent of houses in the Beira, home to more than 530,000 people, had been damaged. Many parts of the city were flooded, and wind damage was extensive.

As humanitarian organizations rushed into Beira to respond, the true extent of the situation became more apparent. Heavy rains and flooding in neighboring countries from previous weeks, combined with the downpour from the cyclone, caused widespread flooding over a large region upstream from Beira. Hundreds of thousands of people, living across the Sofala and Manica provinces were being forced to flee their homes as flooding in the Buzi and Pungwe rivers is causing water as high as six meters to extend over an area 50km beyond the borders of those rivers.

As the search and rescue operations continue across the region, the humanitarian community is ramping up plans to support more than 400,000 people displaced by the flooding. The government is drafting plans to create large-scale camps to house and feed those displaced people as the floodwaters are expected to take weeks to recede.

Voice and data services in the affected area are severely impacted and are expected to continue to have issues as water levels rise. Power is also out in most of the region and the government expects it will take weeks for it to be restored. All major roads into the affected area are either flooded or have been severely damaged, and a fuel shortage is exacerbating the communication and power situation.

## Humanitarian Response Progress

The National Disaster Management Institute (INGC) is leading the response from the national government and the request for international assistance has been made by the President of Mozambique. The international humanitarian community is mobilizing response efforts and a many of NetHope’s members who are active in the region are currently performing needs’ assessments.

The main coordination hub for the response is at Beira Airport where the Emergency Telecommunication Cluster (ETC) has established internet connectivity for the humanitarian community. The ETC has mobilized a number of its partner organizations and has deployed an ETC coordinator to Beira along with an information management officer.

## NetHope Response Progress Report

NetHope has been in close contact with its member organizations since the cyclone hit on March 14. Based on the scale of the situation, NetHope has deployed its Global Director of Field Operations, Rami Shakra, to Mozambique to assess how NetHope can support its member organizations, the ETC, and the broader response community in the coming days and weeks.

In addition to deploying its senior emergency response expert to Mozambique, NetHope has also put members of its Rapid Response Team and partner experts on its response roster on standby for potential deployments. NetHope is planning to issue a Flash Appeal, seeking funding for initial response efforts. NetHope has also mobilized its Crisis Informatics team to support its field teams and member organizations with information management and analysis.

NetHope will issue weekly reports on its work in the region throughout March and early April. NetHope members who wish to provide input or ask questions should feel free to contact John Crowley at [john.crowley@nethope.org](mailto:john.crowley@nethope.org).
